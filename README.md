# FeudalDatabaseWikiTool
A very simple C# winForms program to read XML files from the computer game **Life is Feudal** and convert it into a wiki infobox for the game's official wiki.

# How to Use
1. Download and open the program.
2. Click the *Browse* button and navigate to the data XML files' folder.
 - These four files are required to be in the same folder:
```
data\objects_types.xml
data\recipe.xml
data\recipe_requirement.xml
data\skill_types.xml
```
 - The data XML files are supposedly not shipped with the game anymore.
3. Find the desired item/object in the list.
4. Right-click the list entry and choose either *Create Item Template* or *Create Building Template*.
